# Python, so easy, wow!

This  repo houses a collection of cheat-sheet/tutorials
for teaching the basic concepts Python quickly 
and providing a reference when you need a refresher.

Following my efforts on [Dive into Deep Learning](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en),
I hope the notebooks in this repository will 
make you dangerous in Python as quickly as possible,
while boring you as little as possible.
Sometimes that will mean making tradeoffs along the Pareto-optimal front 
between completeness, efficiency, and engagingness.

Throughout these tutorials we are going to use Python3. 
That's mainly because given the choice, 
it's better to invest in skills that will be useful 
in the foreseeable future. 

These materials are prepared (hopefully!) 
with some help from the open source community,
as course materials for the Introduction to Python and R course
as part of the 
[MSBA program at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business](https://analytics.tepper.cmu.edu/).
