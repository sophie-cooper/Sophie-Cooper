    "In Python a *literal* is a way of expressing an object directly in the syntax of the programming language.\n",
    "Usually this is some primitive piece of data, like a *number*, *string* (of text), *boolean* (true/false value).\n",
    "It's also possible to express more complex objects, such as collection of values (e.g. lists and dictionaries) as literals. However, because we haven't introduced collections yet, let's focus on the primitive values here.\n",
