    "The condition (`<condition>`) is any expression that evaluates to `True` or to `False`. You can also get away with using some other types of values, e.g. numbers, but you better be sure that you understand how python is going to behave in these situations. Is 1 `True`? What about `-1`? What about an infinitesimally small nonzero fraction like `1e-40`? These are ultimately choices made by Python's designers and some of them may be arbitrary. \n",

    "the mandated indentation scheme makes it very easy to tell what's going on in a Python program by inspecting it visually. \n",
    "Programmers in other languages end up needing to deal with this anyway \n",
